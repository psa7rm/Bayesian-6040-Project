# Bayesian-6040-Project
An attempt.

Posterior includes bayesian model prior posterior graph and attempt of sampling and plotting posterior. Model unable to converge. Choice NUTS, Metropolis, and Slice. Changed distributions for certain parameters to t-distribution for robustness, still in vain. Model too complex to deploy ADVI.

GlobalLandTemperatutresByCountry was the most used data.
