# Bayesian-6040-Project
An attempt.

Final_Bayesian contains ensemble model.

Posterior.ipynb includes bayesian model prior posterior graph and attempt of sampling and plotting posterior. Model unable to converge. Choice NUTS, Metropolis, and Slice. Changed distributions for certain parameters to t-distribution for robustness, still in vain. Model too complex to deploy ADVI.

PriorPosterior.ipynb is further model sampling as Posterior.ipynb.

GlobalLandTemperatutresByCountry was the most used data.

All other files are archive models.

Code should run with no error if .csv is uploaded and neccesary packages have been pip installed. Used most recent version of Google Colab.
